Welcome to the Erlang OpenCL binding

To get started you need erlang, preferably R16B or later.
You also need 'rebar3' and a 'C' compiler, i.e.
GCC (or CL.EXE) and a machine with OpenCL installed.

To build and test: rebar3 do compile, edoc, ct

To build examples: Goto the examples directory and run make.

Windows Users:
--------------
The build look for the OpenCL files in /opt/local/ by default.
You can also set the environment variable OPENCL_DIR to point
to another location.

This is an example of howto set up the building env:
I'm assuming you got an mingw environment.

Download a development kit from Nvidia, ATI or Intel:
e.g. http://software.intel.com/en-us/vcsource/tools/opencl-sdk-2013
cp -R /c/Intel SDK/lib /opt/local/
cp -R /c/Intel SDK/include /opt/local/

Example building 64b
------------------------------
Setup windows build environment

c:\src\cl> "c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.cmd" x64

before starting msys (with inherited env)

cl> export PATH="/c/Program Files/erl5.10.1/bin";%PATH%
cl> export PATH="/c/tools/git/cmd";%PATH%
cl> export OPENCL_DIR="c:\Intel~1\"

And build

cl> ../rebar/rebar.cmd compile
=======
If you want to force build with mingw gcc use:
NOCL=true rebar compile
